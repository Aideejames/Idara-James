# Idara-James
Greetings! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Idara James, an AI and Data Science enthusiast with a Master's in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science from the University of Hull, UK. With a robust academic foundation, I bring two years of hands-on experience in crafting and deploying machine learning and deep learning models.

My commitment to continuous learning is evident through my completion of various courses, including "Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification" from Stanford University, the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, and the Deep Learning Specialization. Additionally, I earned certifications in Neural Networks and Deep Learning, along with the AWS Cloud Technology Consultant Professional Certificate by Andrew Ng. These courses have not only fortified my theoretical understanding but have also equipped me with practical skills vital in the field.

My journey extends beyond coursework, as I've actively engaged in diverse projects spanning industries like social media, construction, retail, manufacturing, and banking. These experiences have not only honed my technical skills but have also allowed me to witness the impactful application of AI and data science in real-world scenarios.

Excited to collaborate, innovate, and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of AI and Data Science! ðŸš€ Let's connect and explore the possibilities.
